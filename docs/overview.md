When using Snyk Code Local Engine, no source code leaves the perimeter of your organization. All analysis is performed internally, with only analysis results being sent to Snyk for review through the Snyk Web UI.

Snyk Code Local Engine is built to run on Kubernetes, and supports versions `1.19` to `1.27`. The Snyk Code Local Engine images are built to run on `x86` CPUs.

Proceed to [Installation](installation.md).
